[TOC]

I've recently been upgrading my toolset to the latest versions of Python, Keras, and Tensorflow, all
running on a docker-based GPU-enabled deployment of Jupyter with CUDA 8 installed.  In this notebook
I walk through a quick test to verify that the GPU is recognized and is working, and define and 
train a basic CNN for the classic MNIST digit recognition task.
