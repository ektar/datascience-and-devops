We have several options for a data science front end, but my favorite is Jupyter Hub.  Jupyter
is the rebranded version of IPython, now generalized beyond Python to include R, Julia, Scala,
and many other languages.  Jupyter notebook provides a web-based interface that will allow us to
create analytics experiments and visualize our results in a way that is very convenient for 
cloud-based computing.  Other options include Apache Zeplin and Beaker, but I've found Jupyter
to be the most mature of the various offerings.
